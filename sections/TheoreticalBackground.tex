\section{Theoretical background}

Over the years there have been many studies on ﬁnding distances within graphs. There have been studies on all-pair-shortest-path (APSP) problem. Studies have been conducted on ﬁnding the shortest and farthest distance between two vertices and studies have been done on ﬁnding diameter and radius in the graph.
A lot of approximations were found for these problems.

\newline In this article we will try to focus on the following problems
\begin{itemize}
    \item Finding a graph diameter and finding approximation to the diameter
    \item Finding a graph radius and finding approximation to the radius
    \item Finding the eccentricity of graph and finding approximation to the eccentricity of a graph
\end{itemize}
We will also try to find lower bounds for those problems.
\newline\newline Let $G=(V,E)$ be directed or undirected graph with or witout wieght, where $V$ represent the vertcies and $E$ represent the edges of the graph we say $|V|=n$ and $|E|=m$ where $m =O(n^2)$.
We will use $d(u,v)$ to define the distance betweeen $u$ and $v$ in the graph $G$.

A main question in finding distances in the graphs is finding the diameter of the graph the maximum of the minimum distance between pair of vertices in the graph. The best known algorithm that deals with the problem is the same algoritem that compute the all-pair-shortest-path problem the algoritem finds for each vertex its distance from all the graph vertices using bfs algoritem and then cumpote the maximum distance this algoritem takes $\mathcal{O}(n*(m+n))=\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.

In many algorithms, in order to improve running time, we use the following tools:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Approximation} we use approximation of the original problem with provable guarantees on the distance of the returned solution to the optimal one in order to get better run time.
    \item  \textbf{Randomized} we use randomness as part of the algoritme. there two main Randomized technique "Monte Carlo algorithm" whose output may be incorrect with a certain probability, and "Las Vegas algorithm" whose runtime may be bigger with a certain probability.
\end{itemize}

In an article by Aingworth and Chekuri
\cite{siam1999} they brought an ramdomize algorithm that can distinguish between a graph with a diameter of 2 and a graph with a diameter of 4 in $\mathcal{O}(m \sqrt{n\log n})$ time.
Using that algoritem they show algorithem that estimate $\hat{D}$ for the diameter $D$, such that $\floor{2/3D} \leq \hat{D} \leq D$ in $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(m\sqrt{n}+n^2)$ time. Aingworth and Chekuri also give a open question is there any algotritme that can distinguish between a graph with a diameter of 2 and a graph with a diameter of 3 in less then $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ time.

Liam and Virgina \cite{LV2013} show in there artical how they can improve Aingworth and Chekuri algorithem and get diameter approximation of nearly 2/3 in $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(m\sqrt{n})$ time.
By adding node sampling to Aingworth and Chekuri they get ride from the $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time.
They also show a rudiction form the K-Dominaing-Set problem to prove that under the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis (SETH) no algoritem can distinghs between graph with diameter 2 and graph with diameter 3 in less then $\mathcal{O}(n^{2-\epsilon})$ time.
Liam and Virgina also use the algoritem of Dor, Halperin and Zwick \cite{DHZ2000} All-Pair-Almost-Shortest-Path that compute all distance in grpah $G$ with an additive error $k$ in $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(min\{n^{2-\frac{2}{k+2}}m^{\frac{2}{k+2}},n^{2+\frac{2}{3k-2}}\})$ time.

They also show a new algoritem for dense undirected unweighted graph (dense graph is a graph in which the number of edges is close to $O(n^2)$) that give estimate $\hat{D}$ for the diameter $D$ such that $4/5 \leq \hat{D} \leq D$ in $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(m^{2/3}n^{4/3})$ time.    
After the article of Lian and Virginia, Shiri, Daniel, Liam, Grant, Robert and Virginia 
Show in \cite{SDLLGREV2000} two deterministic algoritems for the diameter with 2/3 approximation one with $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(m^{3/2})$ time and the other $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(mn^{2/3})$ time.
Those two algoritme are the first deterministic algoritems that run in subqaudratic time and give $(2-\epsilon)$-approximation.

Another fundamental set of graph parameters are the Eccentricities, i.e. the largest distance from each vertex. 
Liam and Virginia show in \cite{LV2013} algorithem that when the diameter and the radius are $D,r$ Respectively. For every $u \in V$ estimate $\hat{e(u)}$ such that $max\{r,2/3ecc(u)\} \leq \hat{e(u)} \leq min\{D,3/2ecc(u)\}$ in $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(m\sqrt{n})$.


Shiri, Daniel, Liam, Grant, Robert and Virginia 
Show in \cite{SDLLGREV2000} that a varinet of Liam and Virginia algoritem \cite{LV2013} can give better approximation with the same running time, they show approximation of $3/5e(u)\leq \hat{e(u)} \leq e(u)$.




Abboud, Virginiam and Joshua \cite{AVJ2016} used in Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture to proof that no $\mathcal{O}(n^{2-\epsilon})$ algorithm can achieve better than 5/3 approximation.

More recent result were showen by Lincoln, Virginia and Rayen \cite{AVR2018} prove that under a the complexity of weighted Clique, the eccentricity problem cannot be beaten by any polynomial runtime in the form $\mathcal{O}(mn)$
for $m=O(n^{1+1/k})$ for integer k.


Another closely problem is the Round-Trip-Time of the diameter and the radius. Amir, Virginia and Joshua deifine in \cite{AVJ2016} the RTT-Diameter as follow $max_{u,v}\{d(u,v)+d(u,v)\}$. They found new reduction from the Orthogonal-Vector problem to the Rtt-Diameter problem and the proof that no algorithme can approximate the rtt-diameter problen better then 2/3 in $\mathcal{O}(n^{2-\epsilon})$ time.
