\section{Objectives }

In our research we will try to focus on the problems related to finding distances in graphs. We will address the different types of graphs and the problems that characterize them.
We will try to emphasize some open problems that deal with finding distances in charts such as
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is there any algorithm that can distinguish between diameter 2 and diameter 3 at a time smaller than naive algorithem.
    \item Is there any algorithem for dircted graph that give better approximation then 2/3.
    \item Is there any linar algorithem that give better then 1/2 approximation for the diameter and radius problems.
    \item Is there tighter lower bound to the diameter
    \item Is there Square time algoritem for the eccentricity
\end{itemize}
