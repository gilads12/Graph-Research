\section{Objectives }

%In our research we will try to focus on the problems related to finding distances in graphs. We will address the different types of graphs and the problems that characterize them.

For the diameter approximation algorithms our objectives are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Investigate the open problem shown by Aingworth \etal \cite{siam1999} "Is there is an algorithm with running time of $\mathcal{O}(n^{3-\epsilon})$ for distinguishing between graphs of diameter 2 and 3?" 
    \item Can the $3/2$-approximation ratio for directed graph be improved? Or any lower bound can be found?
    \item Examine the relationship between graphs with small diameter and graphs with a larger diameter. Gives the same approximation ratio for graphs with large diameter and graphs with a small diameter is equally difficult?
    \item Is there exist any linear algorithms that give better than $1/2$-approximation for the diameter and radius problems?
\end{enumerate}
    
    
  %  \item Is there tighter lower bound to the diameter
 %   \item Is there Square time algoritem for the eccentricity
%\end{enumerate}
